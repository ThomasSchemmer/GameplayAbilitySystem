Gameplay Ability System for Unity

I liked Unreal Engines GAS quite a bit while working for it, especially the nice integration into the engine (including UI).
So now I'm reimplementing it in Unity without looking at the original source for a challenge. Don't think I will really finish it, it's mostly for the tags. 

Currently done:
GameplayTag core (with UI)

Next up:
GameplayAbilityComponent
Everything else :D 

This has no license since Unreal did the original work - if they come knocking I will take it down.
